# Lorenz80 🌪️

## 📝 Description

This repository contains an **implementation and study of the Lorenz 1980 model (Lorenz-80)**, originally introduced by E. D. Lorenz in his 1980 paper *“Attractor Sets and Quasi-Geostrophic Equilibrium”*.  

The Lorenz-80 model is a simplified representation of **quasi-geostrophic atmospheric dynamics** and has become a classic example in the study of **chaotic systems**, **low-order climate models**, and **nonlinear dynamics**.  

In this project you will find:

- Implementation of the **Lorenz-1980 equations** in Python and Julia.  
- **Deterministic numerical simulations** of the Lorenz-80 model.  
- **Time series generation**, analysis of the **chaotic attractor**, and sensitivity to initial conditions.  
- **2D and 3D visualizations** of trajectories and attractors.  
- Scripts to export results as CSV files and plots for further analysis.  

This repository is useful for students and researchers interested in **atmospheric science**, **climate modeling**, **chaotic dynamics**, and **numerical methods**.
